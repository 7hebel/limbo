node.outputs is always only one or no values. dont keep it as a list!

render node only if haschanged
store previous RECT in cache with state and clean this rect, not new one

mutliple workspaces?

debug mode : save calls with args and returns into file. (visualize each call?)

(MAYBE) more than one flow_input source (loops?) 

test on linux

NODES:
files nodes category
custom nodes (no special chars in node names / sources)
