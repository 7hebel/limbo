node inputs/outputs end_pos based on index

ONLY ONE output for node (if not FLOW)

SMART RENDER - before printing anything, check if char at given pos has changed to avoid flickering

hz wire ends sometimes have weird arc if close to sy==ey

copy/paste nodes

to .exe???

ctrl + up/down in sidebar - scroll category

statusbar word wrap not letter

sometimes statusbar msg is not reseting after end of action (select node, cancel select)

when node is resized due to set constant value it might get in the way of another node

multiple-output nodeOutput

variables??

save / import files.

if selecting source output for flow, check if target is_flow_node to not select default option.
