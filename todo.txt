cleanup vp_ext

use math.dist() to choose the closest node while shifting focus 

render node only if haschanged
store previous RECT in cache with state and clean this rect, not new one

to exe: skip unused imports

debug mode : save calls with args and returns into file. (visualize each call?)

(MAYBE) more than one flow_input source (loops?) 


NODES:
files nodes category
custom nodes (no special chars in node names / sources)
